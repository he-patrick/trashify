### Inspiration
Our inspiration came from observing the confusion and inefficiency in current recycling practices. We wanted to create a tool that simplifies and encourages responsible waste disposal, making a tangible impact on the environment.

### What it does
Trashify uses AI to revolutionize waste sorting. Users take a photo of their waste, and our app, using TensorFlow-powered image recognition, identifies the material - whether it's plastic, paper, or aluminum - and advises on the correct recycling bin.

### How we built it
We built Trashify using a combination of Next.js for the front-end to capture images and a Flask back-end for handling image uploads. The core functionality leverages TensorFlow for image classification, identifying different types of waste materials.

### Challenges we ran into
We faced challenges in integrating TensorFlow with our Flask back-end and ensuring accurate image recognition. Fine-tuning the model for diverse waste types and handling real-time image processing were significant hurdles.

### What we learned
Throughout this project, we learned about advanced TensorFlow applications, the intricacies of full-stack development, and the importance of user experience in environmental tech solutions.

### What's next for Trashify
Looking forward, we aim to enhance Trashify's accuracy and broaden the range of recognizable materials.
